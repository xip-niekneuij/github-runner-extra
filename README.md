# github-runner-extra

It's myoung34/github-runner, but also [AWS, Git Crypt, Helm, Kubernetes, Terraform] is installed.

## Building flow

The versions in use is whatever the operating system or vendor choose to use at this time.

Every month, the Dockerfile is build and pushed automatically to the `latest` tag.
So don't use this on stuff that seen a last update five years ago or something, it's probably going to get buggy.
